# Employee Database Tracker

This command line tool utilizes a MySQL connection to create and update a simple database for tracking employees and company roles. MySQL2 and inquirer are required for use. Future development on this application includes updating the CLI to display role, department, and manager names instead of the unique ID associated with their entries.
